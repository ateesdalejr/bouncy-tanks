Each tank has a cannon. These can be aimed vertically up and down. As well as having a power metric.
Tanks fire bombs which have delayed explosive fuses. Players can get out of tanks and throw
the explosives back. Explosives have a blast radius attack that instantly kills players
in the radius and slightly damages tanks.

There is a delay to getting out of your tank.
